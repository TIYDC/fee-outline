# Week Three

## Topic Outline

### Day 1

1. JavaScript
  * What is it? Where does it fit into web dev?
  * History
  * Node vs browser (briefly)
1. Executing code (`node filename.js`)
1. Using the console (briefly)
1. Variables and Data Types
  * `let` and `const` (vs `var`), valid names (how can they start, what can they contain?)
  * number, string, boolean, null/undefined, NaN/Infinity, objects (briefly)
  * primitives vs objects (very briefly)
1. Basic expressions (add, subtract, multiply, divide, concatenate)
1. Comments
1. Conditionals
  * if/else/else if, operators (and logical operators), parens (grouping)
1. Functions
  * Basic structure (named args & return)
  * Variable scope (briefly)
  * return ceases execution

Homework: Single-file Code Exercises

### Day 2

1. JavaScript Objects
  * creating literals vs a `new` Object (briefly)
  * primitives vs objects and multiple references (and garbage collection, briefly)
  * properties: creating with object literal, accessing and assigning (dot and brackets), nesting
  * basic methods
1. JavaScript Arrays
  * What are they? Why arrays vs objects? (ordered)
  * numeric indeces (zero-based) and adding entries by index
  * `push`, `forEach`, `includes`
  * iteration with `for` loops (briefly) & length property (zero-based)
1. Basic `require()` (briefly)
1. String `split()` and `trim()` (briefly)

Homework: Word Frequency + FizzBuzz (pair)

### Day 3

1. Using `Object.keys()` for property names
1. JSHint (CLI and in Atom)
  * strict mode (briefly)
1. Unary and compound ops
  * ++, --, discuss before vs after
  * +=, -=, etc
1. Built-in Objects
  * Date: discuss `new`, creation (w & w/o args), timestamps & `Date.now()`, get- methods
  * String: primitive vs object, upper/lower case, `includes`, `substring`, `split`
  * Converting strings to numbers: `parseInt` vs `Number`; mention String casting with concatenation (`''+5`)
  * Math (briefly): just static methods, `max`/`min`, `round`, `random`, `floor`/`ceil`
1. Exporting functions from modules (briefly)
1. Reading test output (briefly)

Homework: Card Game (pair)

### Day 4

1. More on Arrays (_tailor to time_)
  * iteration: `forEach`, `filter`, `map`, `reduce` (?)
  * manipulation: `push`, `pop`, `concat`, `Array.from`, `join`, `slice`/`splice`
1. More on Functions
  * default args and auditing data (ternary?)
  * scope & hoisting
  * arguments "array" (variadic behavior)
  * as expressions and using as values (higher order, passing as args)
  * recursive (_if not covered yet_)
1. Using Node Modules (briefly)
  * Using `fs` to read a file
  * Using `require` to separate your own code

@TODO **CREATE THIS**
Homework: Parking Stats
