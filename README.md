# Frontend Engineering Outline

This is a general outline with notes for the 12-week, full-time Frontend Engineering course taught at The Iron Yard in Washington, DC. The outline is broken down into weeks, although the TIYO path ([latest](https://online.theironyard.com/admin/paths/295)) is broken up by topics. The goal with this repo is to provide a more time-based structure to build off of. That said, it is not intended to be restrictive (or even prescriptive), but rather notes on how things might progress based on experience.

Following each cohort (or even weekly) these notes may be updated to offer insight into areas that could be improved.
